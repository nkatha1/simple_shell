This is a project involving the development of a simple shell whose functionality resembles that of sh shell. The shell is supposed to display a prompt, take input from the standard input, parse it and execute the commands given. The prompt is displayed each time a command has been executed. The project is an important milestone marking the end of the first trimester and the end of C programming language.
